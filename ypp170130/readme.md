# Project Title

SkipList

## Project Description

A **skip list** is a data structure that allows fast search within an ordered sequence of elements. Fast search is made possible by maintaining a linked hierarchy of subsequences, with each successive subsequence skipping over fewer elements than the previous one. Add, Remove, Contains, Floor, Ceiling operations takes O(log n) on average "with high probability". The program also implements rebuild skiplist which creates perfect skiplist which takes O(logn) time.
